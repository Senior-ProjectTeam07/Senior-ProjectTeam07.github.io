ComicContours is a CS 426 Senior Project developed by Team 07. It's an innovative application that uses advanced machine learning techniques to generate caricatures from user-uploaded images. Our solution offers a blend of art and technology, enabling the creation of unique digital avatars and providing a platform for creative expression.

This project is advised by a team of experts from the University of Nevada, Reno's Department of Computer Science and Engineering. We aim to push the boundaries of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and explore the intersection of art and AI in a way that is both engaging and accessible.

Our team is composed of dedicated students:
- Rhiannon Barber
- Karly Amanna
- JoJo Petersky

Instructors & Advisors:
- Sara Davis
- Vinh Le
- Dave Feil-Seifer
- Dr. Emily Hand
