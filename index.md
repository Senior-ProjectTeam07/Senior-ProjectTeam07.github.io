# ComicContours

### CS 426 Senior Projects in Computer Science, Spring 2023
### University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Computer Science and Engineering

## Overview

ComicContours is the capstone project for CS 426 Senior Projects at UNR, developed by Team 7. This cutting-edge application leverages machine learning to transform user-uploaded images into distinctive caricatures, merging the realms of art and technology.

Our project is spearheaded by a group of dedicated students under the guidance of esteemed faculty from UNR's CSE Department. We are venturing into the innovative use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to redefine the interface between artificial intelligence and artistic creation.
