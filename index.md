# ComicContours: Facial Feature Augmentation Using GANs

### CS 426 Senior Projects in Computer Science, Spring 2024
#### University of Nevada, Reno, Department of Computer Science and Engineering

## Project Overview

ComicContours represents the culmination of efforts by Team 7 in the CS 426 Senior Projects course at the University of Nevada, Reno. This project introduces an innovative approach to digital art creation, employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform user-uploaded images into caricatures. Our approach not only facilitates a novel form of artistic creativity but also contributes to the fields of computer vision and machine learning.

## Project Description

ComicContours aims to democratize the process of caricature creation through the application of advanced machine learning techniques, specifically GANs. By automating the traditionally manual and skill-intensive process of caricature drawing, our project opens up new avenues for artistic expression and digital avatar customization. We target a diverse audience ranging from digital art enthusiasts and social media users to professional graphic designers seeking innovative representation methods.

Our technology stack includes PyCharm IDE and libraries such as NumPy, DLib, OpenCV for facial recognition and augmentation, alongside tkinter, shutil, and PIL for the user interface. Security measures are upheld using bcrypt, sqlite3, and email-related libraries to ensure user data protection.

We are committed to regular updates and you can stay informed on our progress, including updates on project deliverables, resources, and news, by navigating through our website.
